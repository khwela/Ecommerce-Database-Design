# eCommerce Database 
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This project is all about building the database for an online store. It keeps track of products, brands, sizes, colors, images, stock levels, and more. If you're learning how eCommerce websites work behind the scenes, you're in the right place!

## What Is This?

This is a **MySQL database** for an online shop. It has all the basic tables you'd need to:

- Add products with different sizes and colors
- Keep track of how many items are in stock
- Store product images
- Add extra details (like weight, material, or any other feature)
- Organize products by brand and category

## How to Set It Up

1. **Create the database:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;
USE ecommerce;
